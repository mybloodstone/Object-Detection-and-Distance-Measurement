## Introduction
    In a traditional image classification approach for object detection there are two well-known 
    strategies.
    For single object in a image there are two scenarios.
        - Classification
        - Localization
    For multiple objects in a image there are two scenarios.
        - Object detection and localization
        - Object segmentation
